# LUXEHABITAT - Modern Furniture Store

Hey there! 👋 This is a portfolio project I built to showcase my frontend skills. It's a modern furniture store concept called LUXEHABITAT. No real transactions here, just a clean, responsive design built with some cool tech.

## What's Inside

- Built with Next.js 14 and React 18
- Styled with Tailwind CSS (because who doesn't love utility classes?)
- Fancy animations using Framer Motion
- Fully responsive - looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops
- Dark/light mode because why not?

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript (because `any` is not a type 😉)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd Ecommerce_portfolio
   ```

2. Install the good stuff
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you're a yarn person
   yarn install
   ```

3. Fire it up
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and take a look around!
